# Practice & Feedback

One of my biggest frustrations is explaining a concept over and over.
For example, I help companies develop process and regularly preach the
importance of prioritization. However, several clients regularly
shuffled priorities for the latest shiny idea no matter how I deter
them.

However, this fault does not fall wholly on the student. Feedback and
practice are two halve of one process. Feedback is not effective without
an opportunity to practice.

> Feedback is not effective without an opportunity to practice

Not all feedback and practice are equal. Too much feedback can overload
a student.

Rather, effective feedback and practice

  - Is centered around an explicit set of goals for the student

  - Plans multiple (sometime many) iterations on the same goal

  - Isolates specific issues, works on them in isolation, and integrates
    them into the bigger picture

  - States the goal in terms of what a student must do and is
    quantifiable

Shorter feedback-practice cycles tend to cement a concept more quickly.
Longer cycles between *teacher* feedback are useful for improving
independence and self-learning. This does not mean fewer total cycles.
Rather, students should be prepared with tools for developing their own
feedback cycles.

## Signs of Failure

  - Little improvement with feedback

  - High student effort with little improvement

## Tools

  - Practice Formats – Provide effective practice plans and strategies.
    If improving practice is an expected outcome, measure it (observe
    them practicing, self-reports, practice logs, etc)

  - Practice Reflections – Ask students to assess how their practice
    factored into their performance on an assignment and how they can
    improve it next time.

  - Structured Peer Feedback – Have students assess each other’s work
    with some process guidance. Students also learn by identifying good
    and bad qualities in peer work

  - Rubrics – Helps students create their own feedback loop by providing
    clear expectations
