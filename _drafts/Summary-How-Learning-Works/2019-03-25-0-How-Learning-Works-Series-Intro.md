As professionals, we’ve all (probably) experienced that co-worker,
intern, or boss who just doesn’t get it. They continue in their ways no
matter how many times something is explained or progress slowly.

In this situation, you are an educator.

Learning and teaching are two views of the same process. However, those
views don’t always line up. Each individual’s past experiences, goals,
subject mastery, learning habits, and the environment can all cause
disconnects. Not just these qualities in students, but in the teacher as
well. Teachers are often in a very different stage than their students
in each of these dimensions, which makes disconnects complex and opaque.

While the ‘student’ is not free of responsibility, there are powerful
ways you can bridge this disconnect. Research elucidates key components
of learning, factors that affect those components, and techniques that
facilitate effective teaching.



TODO: 
- Add reference to inspections somewhere?
- fill out this intro to make more sense
  - consider reframing the series a bit
    - depersonalize examples
    - introduce as my effort to connect, consolidate, and prepare for reference all that I learned in these books
    - repackaged a bit to share with the public that others may benefit too.
    - Also split into more bite-sized chunks

- add the post meta
- fill in images quotes, and other formatting that went missing
- consider rephrasing some of the frustrations into more neutral tones
