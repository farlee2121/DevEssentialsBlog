- i've been learning a lot about type systems. 
- heard nominal and structural thrown out there
- here's what they mean and some of the benefits of each


- start with contrast & examples
- then get into benefits


- structural
  - more fluid
  - easy to combine
  - operate on the type itself (like key/value shennanigans in js,)
- Nominal
  - i don't actually know the benefits here, need to research. my guess is performance


Thinking beyond a language means thinking beyond type systems too.
Shouldn't take type system for granted. It is a means to express your design.Explore some super different languages to get familiar with the tools at your disposal.
