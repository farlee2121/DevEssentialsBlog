# Qualities of a Good Dev Environment

- Flags for caution / good dev envs encourage boldness?
  - mostly want to set up our development environments to not require caution
    - good dev env can be totally rebuild quickly if needed
    - good dev env should have no chance of messing irreplacable data or assets
    - good dev envs should never interrupt/effect other contributors until work is integrated
    - should be forced checks between dev env and possibly of damage. Safe to be bold until you're forced into the very good practice of making sure you don't break other people's stuff and your work works as expected
    - kinda like immutability in programming languages. Principle of least surprise
  - when is caution needed
    - live data
    - live anything
    - permanent loss 
    - possibility of breaking others




<!-- - Basics of Governance?
  - essence is decentralizing responsibility... maybe managing levels of trust is a better way of saying it. Flip side is managing levels of risk. It's about how much risk you're willing to accomodate from certain personnel. 
    - example: the company owner in small to medium businesses can generally sink the company if they want to. Therefore, there isn't much additional risk if they can access many assets. There is risk though if they might hand that access to someone else, or mistakenly mismanage an asset. 
  - tools are anything that forces review or multip
  - can generally be forced through some replication with separate ownership
  - feeling a bit meh on this one...

Turn jack discussion into blog post
- not about who, but what -> guaranteeing a level of quality before integration / ability to impact others. Some kinds of verification may require special expertise. Main path should avoid expertise and set up flags to trigger additional reviews for less frequent or specialized concerns. Else experts become a team bottleneck. Here's my first pass at defining a such a review checklist
- maybe also mention multiple reviewers as process assurance
