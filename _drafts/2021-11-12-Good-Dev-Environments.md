- Flags for caution / good dev envs encourage boldness?
  - mostly want to set up our development environments to not require caution
    - good dev env can be totally rebuild quickly if needed
    - good dev env should have no chance of messing irreplacable data or assets
    - good dev envs should never interrupt/effect other contributors until work is integrated
    - should be forced checks between dev env and possibly of damage. Safe to be bold until you're forced into the very good practice of making sure you don't break other people's stuff and your work works as expected
    - kinda like immutability in programming languages. Principle of least surprise
  - when is caution needed
    - live data
    - live anything
