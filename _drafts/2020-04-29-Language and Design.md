excerpt: "IBM found that every hour of code inspection saved 100 hours of related work. Pair programmers produce higher quality, more
maintainable, code in 15% more time than an individual,
and inspected systems require 1/10th the maintenance of non-inspected systems.

These a few of stats supporting collaboration and review in software. Teams that regularly collaborate work faster, learn faster, and have fewer defects."
