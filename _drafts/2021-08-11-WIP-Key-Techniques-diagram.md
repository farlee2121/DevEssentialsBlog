<!-- How do I handle key techniques for cross-cutting concerns? critical thought?

- I could use lines from each topic to it's techniques, but that would get crowded
- I could use multiple diagrams
- I could divide techniques by cross-cutting concern within lifecycle phases
  - that doesn't allow me to show techniques that belong everywhere or may be alternatives (like kanban/scrum)

<!-- TODO: I want to differentiate standard vs my recommendation

Do I even want to tackle this before enumerating the standard?

Key Techniques

## Requirements

Can pull from testing post


Event Storming
Prototypes
Mockups
Stories


## Design

Req: Duck docs and incremental tree search

Plugin Architecture (Clean Architecture)

Prototypes 
Mockups
Threat matrix


## Construction

- Style standards
- TDD
- Pseudo-Code programming process
- Expressions
  - clean handoffs
  - easy to refactor piece-wise

## Testing

- Test Api
  - efficient at both individual and team level. Scales to inter-team contracts with minimal extra complexity
- BDD
-
