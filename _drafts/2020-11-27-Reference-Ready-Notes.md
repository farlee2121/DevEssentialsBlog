I've fallen in love with Markdown and it is slowly permiating all of my documents. The latest addition is notes, which Markdown makes easy to reference either manually or programmatically!

## How I got here

## Reference Metadata

re-introduce normalized meta-data
multi-post docs & literate configuration
some of my tag formatting
search with vs code

## Powerful Possibilities

notes effectively become a database
Plaintext and existing interleaved metadata paradigm means I can interact with my notes with a vast set of existing tools
