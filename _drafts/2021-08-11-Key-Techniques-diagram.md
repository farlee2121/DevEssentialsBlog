<!-- How do I handle key techniques for cross-cutting concerns? critical thought?

- I could use lines from each topic to it's techniques, but that would get crowded
- I could use multiple diagrams
- I could divide techniques by cross-cutting concern within lifecycle phases
  - that doesn't allow me to show techniques that belong everywhere or may be alternatives (like kanban/scrum)
