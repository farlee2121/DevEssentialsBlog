# Small Quibble with The Great Rewriting in Rust.
[The Great Rewriting in Rust](https://deprogrammaticaipsum.com/the-great-rewriting-in-rust/) is a good overview of why Rust is a compelling and growing language.
However, I have a small quibble with how it refers to F#.

The article states
> F#, Dart, Swift, or Kotlin either, which seem to be more interested in replacing the null keyword with optionals, thereby solving Sir Hoare‚Äôs mistake.

Sir Hoare‚Äôs mistake is referring to null. I can't speak to Dart, Swift, and Kotlin, but I know F# rather well. My dabbling in Rust was fairly easy because I found it shares many language choices with F#.

I'll compare F# against the article's listed good qualities of Rust to demonstrate

- ‚úÖ [Open Source](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp)
  - 
- ‚úÖ [Generics](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/completeness-anything-csharp-can-do/#generics)
- ‚úÖ [Optionals](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/the-option-type/)
- ‚ùå/üü® Ad-hoc polymorphism (traits)
  - It's possible with static member constraints, but not great
- üü®/‚úÖ Results over Exceptions
  - F# treats exceptions similar to Rust. Results are preferred, but exceptions are still available. Rust just calls them [panic](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.panic.html).

- ‚úÖ Strong and static typing
- ‚úÖ [Simple install](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/windows?tabs=net60)
- ‚úÖ Extensive built-in functionality
  - F# benefits from the robust .NET Base Class Library

- ‚úÖ [Immutable by default](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/tutorials/functional-programming-concepts#immutability)
- üü® Macros
  - I'm not sure macros are a 100% positive. I've not gone deep with Rust macros, but other languages I've used with syntactic macros showed some [downsides along with the good](../_posts/2021-09-17-Macros-not-a-clear-win.md). F# does have [Type Providers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/tutorials/type-providers/) and [Quotations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/code-quotations) for more constrained meta-programming.
- ‚ùå Primitive arrays include length in type declaraion
  - F# doesn't have this, but I rarely care about fixed-length collections in F#
- üü® Blazing fast
  - F# is fast enough for most applications, but Rust definitely has an edge in low-level performance.
- üü® Static linking
  - [Possible with .NET](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1868449/static-linking-of-libraries-created-on-c-sharp-net), but not as mainstream
- ‚úÖ [WebAssembly](https://fsbolero.io/)
- ‚úÖ Active community (conferences, Q&A, [Online sandbox](https://try.fsharp.org/), [great learning materials](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/), etc)
- ‚úÖ No GOTO / Proper structured programming
  - This one actually surprised me. C# technically has GOTO, even if it's rarely used. F# decided to leave it out though. Good for them.


As you can see, F# shares most of the listed benefits of Rust. Thus I think his poke at F# for mostly managing null is unwarranted.

That said, there are certainly good reasons to choose each of the languages over the other. F# developers can skip the complications of hardware and interop with a wide world of existing .NET software. They can also leverage an incredibly mature .NET tooling ecosystem. Rust, on the other hand, can cater to even the most strict low-level performance requirements.

Rust is great language. I'm glad to see Rust gain traction, but don't discount F#!
