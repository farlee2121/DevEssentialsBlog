# Hierarchy of chapters (separate post)

Tiers based on how fundamental each is 
- mid tier built on concepts and measures of bottom tier
- outer tier integrates the middle tier at every stage
- outer tier is the general form of the software process loop. That loop may be very short and on smaller decisions in some methodologies
- true center tier is problem solving (13.1.1 everything is problem solving and specialized techniques separate out into disciplines)

Econ is actually in management and not in foundations, but economics is the differentiation between engineering and science
Maintenance is in management section, not sure if I should include it in the middle or outer tier...
- everything is maintained, and maintenance is more of a perspective, but it sorta has a position in the process flow

<!-- I like how Construx separates out cross-cutting *activities* and cross-cutting *concerns*
- their visual makes more sense to me now -->

intro divides sections into
- development
- management
- Professional Practice
- foundations


- should probably indicate that i'm not sold on where maintenance lives
- moved economics to foundations because it factors into most decision processes.
