# DDD Reading Review

It's easy to see how Domain Driven Design (DDD) by Eric Evans was such a seminal work. It seems to have forecast the next two decades of development ideals and communicates a clear system for 

- see how DDD shapes modern development
- Many ideas not new to me. Seen them in various other talks and books


Primary points
- minimizing fields on entity (and into value objects) as good source of domain inspiration 
- creating the glossary 
   - helped me notice the lack of terms around our core domain. Had many domain terms, but not for some of the defining parts of our business
   - still unproven as a team mechanism, but seems promising. Non-devs can edit with something like github wiki. Part of code reviews

Could also talk about 
- functional connections
- Specifications
- Weight of OO vs the relative intuition of Wlaschin's method
- Focus on refactoring and cost of up-front structure
- Problem focus at every level
