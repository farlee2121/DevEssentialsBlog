# Choosing a Text Editor

I've long used used Microsoft Word as my pair programming partner. I call them Duck Docs

could also generally approach this as crafting my blog dev environment.

Want to get into why i've moved from word to markdown for note taking

- easy transition between environments
- code process and note /writing process can be handled the same (same editors, source control)
- easier to programmatically manipulate (just about everything works on plain text)
- easier to extend (arch diagrams / plant uml)
- rich ecosystem of md-driven tools (jekyll for blogs, slide tools, etc)
Trying to follow my own dev essential teaching. Tools for what I want to be easy, DRY, small set of core concepts that apply in many scenarios, easy to iterate, track, and refactor
