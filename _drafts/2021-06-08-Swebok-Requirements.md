<!-- core swebok post
- not for general audiences
- it even talks about how it is a standard for creating other materials (certs, accrediations, ...)
- great citation and reference 
- further readings good for learning the enumerated concepts. Concisely states the value of each further reading 

high-level impression: design and architecture didn't seem very helpful. Not sure the value of separating maintenance. SCM, Quality, process, testing were all quite good. 
I think this relects an actual gap in standards for design/architecture, or at least in communicating those standards versus other software concerns

Highly recommend 13.1, 13.2, 13.3
