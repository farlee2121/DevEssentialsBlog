# Reading Review: Professional Software Development

What did the book try to do? 
what were the major concepts I saw? Which ones stood out to me as fundamental relatable lessons

Good
- sets up a schema, fundamental beliefs, about what the software industry is currently like and what it could be like
  - also some of the critical ways of thinking about software (no silver bullet, essence/accident)
- More personal, good to hear about his path to professionalism


Would would I do differently?
- want more about practices. focuses on the industry and doesn't talk much about the knowledge/techniques that have been accumulated and should be used

Very influenced by brooks
mapping of chapters to blog posts
