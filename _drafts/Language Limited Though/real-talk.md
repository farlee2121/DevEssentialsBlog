My results post lacks focus. I need to orient myself to make these posts worth while.
as my opener states, each post needs to be centered around FP ideas and why the FP ideas bring clarity
Should probably split nullable in some way. Either give it it's own solution section or make another post



// absense of value not a first class notion
// I feel like each of these posts should focus on some concept that functional languages embody and OO doesn't
 - Result => idea of nothing
 - Overloading => or typing
 - Id => more a nice side-effect of discrimintated unions
 - Service orientation -> referential transparency, statelessness means separation of data and function
 - AOP => composition, the idea of functions not as an instruction set, but as transforms or operations. Also monads and the idea of unit / space translations

composition post

 - maybe give an aside about how a solid understanding the functional systems is greatly aided by understanding the mathematic inspiriations tuples- > multiplication -> vectors -> AND. Create a grid with an axis for every place. Discriminated unions -> addition -> OR. Any instance is a just one value of a sum of possible types. Monads are like a map -> they take a value and they shift it to a bijectional space (think how lapace lets us convert between frequency and time). Types, including fuctions, can be operated on in accordance with their rule sets (tuples as vectors, )
   - composition and piping. Just like in math, functions are pushed as a conceptual operation, not just a collection of instructions. Keeping behaviors small and adding them up is very easy (examples: validation, async, optional). This is really a discussion for AOP post
 - discriminated unions. more than just sometimes a value, it's any kind of OR
 - Map and Bind (monad, but not necessary to understand)
 - railway-oriented (map and bind let you shuffle error handling to the side)
