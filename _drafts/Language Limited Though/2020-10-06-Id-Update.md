# Id abstractions in C# 9

I [previously wrote]() on the difficulties of abstracting ID types in C#. Good news, C# 9 record types greatly simplify this design decision.

Record types are immutable reference types with value-based equality semantics. 

In other words

// show object comparisons
// show setting a property makes a new object
// then explain how this makes ids easy
```cs
record Person{
    public string First {get; }
    public string Last {get; }
}

bool equal = new Person{ "Bob", "Person"} == new Person {"Bob", "Person"}; // true

```

And 

```cs 
// show changing a record and it doesn't equal the old record
```

This makes id types pretty trivial

// hmm, couldn't I have done all of this with structs? No, structs don't implement == and similar

// should also cover the inheritance case, which couldn't be done with structs because all structs are sealed
Suppose you need interoperability between a set of ID types. This would have been very awkward before because inherited methods could not return . C# 9 makes it simple with covarient returns

```cs
    record BaseId : IComparable<BaseId>{

        protected Guid _id {get; init;};

        public virtual BaseId Default(){
            return new BaseId{ _id = default()};
        }

        public virtual BaseId New(){
            //...exposing new makes it hard to use sequential id types like int, but you may not care
        }

        public int CompareTo(BaseId other){
            //...
        }

    }

    record ChildId : BaseId, IComparable<ChildId>{
        public override ChildId Default(){
            return new ChildId{ _id = default()};
        }

        public override ChildId New(){
            return new ChildId{_id = base.New()._id};
        }

        public int CompareTo(ChildId other){
            //...
        }
    }
```
