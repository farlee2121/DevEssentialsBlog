# Id abstractions in C# 9

I [previously wrote]() on the difficulties of abstracting ID types in C#. Good news, C# 9 record types greatly simplify this design decision.

Record types are immutable reference types with value-based equality semantics. 

In other words

// show object comparisons
// show setting a property makes a new object
// then explain how this makes ids easy
