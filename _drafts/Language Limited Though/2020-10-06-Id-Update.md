# Id abstractions in C# 9

I [previously wrote](./2020-05-08-Id-Abstraction.md) on the difficulties of abstracting ID types in C#. Good news, C# 9 record types greatly simplify this design decision.

Record types bring the functional definition of data to C#. That is, they are immutable with value-based equality semantics. 

In other words

```cs
record Person{
    public string First {get; }
    public string Last {get; }
}

bool equal = new Person { First = "Bob", Last = "Person"} == new Person {First = "Bob", Last = "Person"}; // true

```

And 

```cs 
Person original = new Person { First = "Bob", Last = "Person"};
Person updated = original with { First = "Robert"};

bool equal = original == updated; // false;
```

This makes id types pretty trivial

```cs
record PersonId : IComparable<PersonId>{
    private Guid _id {get; init;}

    public static readonly PersonId Default = new PersonId { _id = Guid.Empty };

    public int CompareTo(PersonId other){
        return _id.CompareTo(other._id);
    }
}
```

All we have to do is implement compare and expose a default value, everything else is automatic.

But wait, aren't structs suppose to use value-semantics? Ids wouldn't be too big for a value-type either (records are reference types).  
Well... structs have value semantics, but only implement `.Equal()`. Any operators like `==` and `!=` have to custom implemented, which means you also have to implement `GetHashCode`. It ends up being a lot of boiler-plate code.

## Inheritance and Covariance

C# 9 also introduces covarient overrides, which make inter-operable ID types relatively simple too.

```cs
    record BaseId : IComparable<BaseId>{

        protected Guid _id {get; init;};

        public virtual BaseId Default(){
            return new BaseId{ _id = default()};
        }

        public virtual BaseId New(){
            //...exposing new makes it hard to use sequential id types like int, but you may not care
        }

        public int CompareTo(BaseId other){
            //...
        }

    }

    record ChildId : BaseId, IComparable<ChildId>{
        // Notice how the override returns the child type. That wasn't possible in C# 8.
        public override ChildId Default(){
            return new ChildId{ _id = default()};
        }

        public override ChildId New(){
            return new ChildId{_id = base.New()._id};
        }

        public int CompareTo(ChildId other){
            //...
        }
    }
```

## Closing thoughts

I normally don't spend much time oogling over language features, but I gotta say that C# 9 introduces some powerful changes.
Just these two improvements allow me to much better encode my design intent. At last I will have practical ID abstractions!
