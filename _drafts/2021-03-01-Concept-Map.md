Trying to make a concept map, a schema for what there is to know about programming, but also folds in some of my views.

Existing Resources
- swebok: a stellar resource. It's objective, holistic, manageable to read, and points to more detailed resources
- Construx Career Ladder
  - Easy to comprehend
  - Orthogonalized? can use the same progression chart for many different roles. Also allowing different roles to understand about the others. Minimizes brainspace to understand the broader picture. Minimized rework to customize or create new career paths
  - design to create a complete picture
- Pragmatic programmer
  - full of great wisdom
  - A bit uneven with it's level of abstraction in addressing concepts
  - not designed to make a complete picture of software skills
- Clean series
  - split into personal habits, coding habits, and architecture
  - still need to read to pass judgement here
  - Not an objective full map of software skills
- Code Complete
  - supposedly focused on construction, but does give a good overview
  - A massive tome. Not approachable or easily read through for a complete picture
- Professional software Development?


Ok, so what do I want my map to be
- Dev-Focused: Mostly care about devs. Accomodate others if possible, but not necessary
- Holistic, should outline the larger picture of what a dev should know
- Practical: a tidbit for every essential skill that the reader can immediately start practicing no matter their situation
- Individual-focused: this is for the reader to apply to themselves, not to start an organization program
- Launchpad: reader knows where to go next to fill out their knowledge of each topic
- Grade-able: I would like to be able to evaluate (and let the reader self-evaluate) where they are in each skill and overall
- Accessible: above all, I want it to be quick to grasp and feel approachable



IDEA: maybe i base by ruberic on a matrix of key activities versus the maturity model?
- i don't have to address every level. I probably want to teach to the highest, but it gives me an objective third-party scale with understandable gates. I can still aggregate total skill based on sub-skills if needed. I don't plan to go into such depth as construx with defined activities for each cell
- How does this jive with the problem-solving matrix?
  - control is kinda like repeatability
  - measurement kinda in both

Split into two posts. First one is just on other materials of similar purpose
