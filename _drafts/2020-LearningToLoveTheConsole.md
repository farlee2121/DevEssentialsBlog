- Why was I so meh about the console?
  - I feel like there I had a mentor that felt that way... hmm
    - maybe reactionary from things like Emacs that people seemed to love in college as a way to feel cool. because they were "real devs" similar to the linux obsession
  - didn't often have to customize
  - was in an environment that didn't really invest in tool making
  - 
- similar to Code, at first i was unimpressed. I was used to my editor doing more out of the box and I failed to see the canvas
- my optinion started to change when I read Pragmatic Programmer

- even with the ease, the console is still a UI, and it deserves a good UX
  - dragonfruit, System.Console take care of it for you
