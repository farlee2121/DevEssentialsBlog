# What's your Duck: Conclusion

## Conclusion

The main goal of this series was to build a mental model for healthy software design process.

To do this we explored
- What is programming? Software Engineering?
- How do we effectively break down problems?
- Can software be perfect?
- What makes software good?

Software is fundamentally a design activity trying to model problems as automated processes.
Banishing vague notions is a primary responsibility for programmers, who incrementally break of
unknowns from the problem to zero in on clear and satisfactory solutions. 
There is no perfect solution, only solutions that meet our known needs.

Communicating ideas clearly is central to effective process at all stages. Duck docs are but one
flexible technique for getting ideas out of our heads, making them clear, and balancing solutions against our problem's goals and constraints.
