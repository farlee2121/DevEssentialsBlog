# What's your Duck V2: Series Intro

This series is about design process and organizing our thoughts for effective development. The main goal is to establish a healthy mental model and intuition for effective design process. The duck bit will be explained later.

The general layout of the series is
- Fundamental questions: understanding the big picture of software and design motivations

<!-- 
TODO: consider putting a warning in What's your duck pointing to this post as the presentation companion -->

<!-- 
IDEA: make this post a series to make it more approachable / smaller increments
TODO: Do I need to group section by what I think belongs in one post? Clearly delineate chunks that need to be taken as a whole
I think at least the stage-specific techniques might be good as a separate post. Most everything up to there flows pretty well
-->


<!-- Meta thoughts
This feels so much different from writing my other posts. I can see all the effort I put into connecting back 

Thinking about this as a potential series causes me to write each section intro like a blog intro and forge stronger context clarity

## Motivating Questions

First, here are a few motivational questions.
- What is programming? Software Engineering?
- How do we effectively break down problems?
- Can software be perfect?
- What makes software good?

I'd encourage you to take a few minutes and organize your own thoughts on these questions before moving ahead. You don't have to have an answer, ideas and questions are good too. Connecting and theorizing [aid the learning process](../../_posts/2022-03-07-Small-Teaching-Review.md#predicting).
