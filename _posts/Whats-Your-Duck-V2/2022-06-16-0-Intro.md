# What's your Duck V2: Series Intro

This series is about design process and organizing our thoughts for effective development. The main goal is to establish a mental model and intuition for effective design process. The duck bit will be explained later.

<!-- Meta thoughts
This feels so much different from writing my other posts. I can see all the effort I put into connecting back 

Thinking about this as a potential series causes me to write each section intro like a blog intro and forge stronger context clarity
 -->

The first two posts will answer key motivation questions and establish key concepts of design process
- What is programming? Software Engineering?
- How do we effectively break down problems?
- Can software be perfect?
- What makes software good?

The later posts provide examples for applying these foundational ideas.

I'd encourage you to take a few minutes and organize your own thoughts on these questions before moving ahead. You don't have to have an answer, ideas and questions are good too. Connecting and theorizing [aid the learning process](../../_posts/2022-03-07-Small-Teaching-Review.md#predicting).

When your ready, move into [Software as Clarity](2022-06-16-1-Software-as-Clarity.md).
