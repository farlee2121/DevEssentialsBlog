I love to read and explore new ideas, especially in software. Many software thought leaders share their thoughts in writting.
There is a robust body of knowledge out there, but it can hard to get acquainted with. I owe most of my connection to great writings to
other writings I've read. I thought I'd collect some of my favorite books into a list to get others started and short cut the laborious crawl between sources.

This is not a blog post because I plan to update it over time. I generally avoid editing my blogposts once they're public.

<!-- What about the reading list. What do i want to accomplish?
- I've found it helpful when other people make reading lists. I mostly want to guide people into some of the books that helped me most
- I think I could round out the sections i've already created and that's a pretty good start
 -->

<!-- I don't think i'll make this  -->
## Fundamentals overview
<!-- TODO: a little description of what each covers -->
- Code That Fits in Your Head
- No Silver Bullets
- What is Software Design
- What's Your Duck
  - This is my own series. Read Design of Design for more
- Pragmatic Programmer?
  - learning languages, tightening net, understandability, thinking about compatability, ...
- Refactoring
  - Preparatory refactoring, short test and scm-based loops
- [A Little Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2016/01/04/ALittleArchitecture.html)
- Four Languages from Forty Years Ago
  - Why to learn different programming paradigms. Good qualities in programming languages
- Code: The hidden language of computer hardware and software

Still only poked around a bit, but DORA seems like a strong candidate for this group
<!-- from foundational beliefs post, clear that Refactoring, Design of Design, No Silver Bullets, Code Complete, Domain Driven Design, Pragmatic Programmer are some my most influential sources-->

<!-- 
// this list is big enough that 1. I might want to generate it from my notes 2. I probably want to turn it into a data source and generate a table
// Title, author(s), link, maybe some tags, maybe a link to my blog post(s) about the book
I can look into hugo's data features. Or just load a json file

When I write the post for this table, reference markdown
