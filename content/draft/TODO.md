- FsCheck saga
  - better understanding delegates (target issue) 
- Pact https://pact.io/. An interesting and good tool, but not as full a replacement as advertized. It's basically a assertion-less property test. Perhaps a bit smarter than that. It seems like they sample real data, which would make it an operational profile test. Again, useful but not a replacement for good behavioral tests, especially since developer tests are partially about helping the developer think critically about their problem, not just for verifying the behavior. Good developer tests also aren't fragile (still working on that series, but have some test api posts)
- try to make some incremental duck examples?? (demonstrate working through a duck? maybe skip through several stages to show techniques/questions applied at those stages)
- OCP Q&A add-on post
- Explore https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_taxonomy and https://blog.edmentum.com/webb%E2%80%99s-depth-knowledge-framework-basics as a means of more effective/intentional question asking
- Standards over control? 
  - I think I want more application with this before I give it a dedicated post
  - flow over prediction related to distributed architecture over central planning (might have more info in my Scaling Architecture Conversationally notes) -> Decentralized decision making means faster feedback loops, greater scalability. 
  - Refine the guardrails/SOP over controling specifics. Not easy though.
- I can probably wring a post or two out of my Ionide contributions 
  - maybe talking about minimal parameters / the refactoring I did early on could be a good case study in information hiding
  - probably just show of some of the challenges I was able to overcome (multiple sources, not all aligned; updating from code)
  - can probably do a high-level one that's essentially just the PR

Longer-form 
- NOTE: don't try tackling these as one great series. I think it'll be easier to tackle them as individual posts (maybe give them a tag or a retroactive series so people can work through the similar posts)
- What's your duck process applied to construction process in concrete technique demonstrations (probably many posts)
  - interpolation (via logs, commenting, breakpoints, etc)
  - NOTE: perhaps some of these examples follow SPEAC so we can also show that in these examples too. Possibly as a driver of sorts (inconsistent level of abstraction / reads smoothly, implementation-specific concerns in signature, need to add an alternative implementation, etc)
  - a Driver-based loop (namely with tests, then some refactorings)
  - Dealing with some legacy code (strangler and related) -> a multi-phase refactor is a sort of hypothesis about what would make a better shape/api/factoring and then you give it a limited trial without turning everthing over 
  - remember to tie things back to test-hypothesis and increments
