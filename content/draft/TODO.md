backup idea queue
- Contrast clojure.spec DbC with FsSpec and type-driven approach
- FsCheck saga
  - sneaky constructor problems in F# (initialization <> construction & front bit is initialization if you have default constructor)
  - better understanding delegates (target issue) 
- Pact https://pact.io/
- Realizing F# records can be inherited only when I studied scala and a tutorial mentioned the scala equivalent can't (been 4+ years) -> really don't need inheritance of concrete types for good design. I use it so little I didn't notice in 4+ years.
- sub-domains as company responsibilities being an expression of SRP. Isolating competing design forces (look up notes from doug event storm)
