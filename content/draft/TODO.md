- FsCheck saga
  - better understanding delegates (target issue) 
- Pact https://pact.io/
- try to make some incremental duck examples??
- OCP Q&A add-on post
- Explore https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_taxonomy and https://blog.edmentum.com/webb%E2%80%99s-depth-knowledge-framework-basics as a means of more effective/intentional question asking
- Standards over control? 
  - I think I want more application with this before I give it a dedicated post
  - flow over prediction related to distributed architecture over central planning (might have more info in my Scaling Architecture Conversationally notes) -> Decentralized decision making means faster feedback loops, greater scalability. 
  - Refine the guardrails/SOP over controling specifics. Not easy though.
- Test likeness (not sure I use that term right). creating structures to represent the full expected context of a test for cleaner assertions with more helpful messages
- I can probably wring a post or two out of my Ionide contributions 
  - maybe talking about minimal parameters
  - probably just show of some of the challenges I was able to overcome (multiple sources, not all aligned; updating from code)

Longer-form 
- NOTE: don't try tackling these as one great series. I think it'll be easier to tackle them as individual posts
- What's your duck process applied to construction process in concrete technique demonstrations (probably many posts)
  - interpolation (via logs, commenting, breakpoints, etc)
  - NOTE: perhaps some of these examples follow SPEAC so we can also show that in these examples too. Possibly as a driver of sorts (inconsistent level of abstraction / reads smoothly, implementation-specific concerns in signature, need to add an alternative implementation, etc)
  - a Driver-based loop (namely with tests, then some refactorings)
  - Dealing with some legacy code (strangler and related) -> a multi-phase refactor is a sort of hypothesis about what would make a better shape/api/factoring and then you give it a limited trial without turning everthing over 
  - remember to tie things back to test-hypothesis and increments
