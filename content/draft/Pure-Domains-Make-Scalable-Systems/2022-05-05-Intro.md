This is the first post in a series exploring the benefits of pure domains for scalability. It introduces important terms, ideas, and some examples.

The central concept of this series is a system where the business rules (domain) don't change the system state. Instead they return data and let consumers enact the corresponding change. Such a system is maximally event-driven and simplifies some difficult problems in high-scale systems.

This approach is sometimes called Functional Core Imperative Shell, since the pure domain takes many ideas from functional programming while state changes are enacted imperatively at the application boundaries.

## A Pure Domain through Events

There are a few terms critical to understanding this series.

- [Domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design): Domain refers to our core problem or business. Domain can also refer to the "domain layer" that reflects domain rules in the software. So if were writing accounting software, it's the part that encodes the rules of accounting. Non-domain code are incidental to the business, like sending emails or storing data in a database. How we notify users or store data could change without changing how the business works. Systems will commonly have many sub-domains. 
- Pure: Pure refers to [pure functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function), which are functions that always return the same output given the same input and have no [side-effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)). Essentially, they don't rely on or change the system state. They simply map inputs to outputs. Pure functions are deterministic. They always return the same output given the same input.
- [Event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture): Events represent some change in program state. For example, the user clicked a UI element, or an item was sold.


A pure domain layer is then the our core business rules implemented decoupled from direct system state. 

Pure domain rules can only effect system state through the data they return. The returned data is effectively an event.

A pure domain also only know about data you pass. They don't depend on any implicit state. The sum of all of our arguments to a domain function are the whole context. This data acts like a command. Commands can be thought of as client (e.g. user) triggered events.

Relying on data (commands and events) to create pure functions is based in *Dependency Rejection*. Scott Wlaschin has an excellent [series](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/dependencies-4/) on how dependency rejection relates to other dependency approaches.

## Examples

A pure domain may be hard to picture at first. Here are some resources if you want to explore.
- [Domain Modeling Made Functional's](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/books/#domain-modeling-made-functional) is an accessible and fantastic overview to this kind of programming.
  - Scott also covers much of this material in a [blog series](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/series/designing-with-types/) and a [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Up7LcbGZFuo&ab_channel=NDCConferences)
- Mark Seemann covers this approach as [Functional Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=US8QG9I1XW0&ab_channel=NDCConferences). 

- I've also written a [sampling of the approach](../../posts/2021-04-09-Designing-with-Events-Transforms-and-state.md), and developed an [exploratory system](https://github.com/farlee2121/BlockScheduler) based on the approach. 

Here's a simple sample endpoint.
```fsharp
type BlockWebsite = SiteBlockCommand -> Result<SiteBlockCreated, SiteBlockError>
type SiteBlockCommand = {
  Url: String
  Schedule: Schedule
}

type Schedule = 
| OneTime of TimeSpan
| Repeating of DayOfWeek list * TimeOnly * TimeSpan // Days, StartTime, Duration

type SiteBlockError = 
| InvalidUrl of string
| ConflictingRule of WhitelistRuleId

type SiteBlockCreated = {
  BlockStartTimestamp: DateTime
  SiteUrl: Uri
  BlockId: BlockId
}
```

`BlockWebsite` wouldn't persist a site block rule. Instead it returns data respresenting the change in state. In this case, the data to create a block rule. The application boundary (e.g. REST API, console application, or other clients) then passes this data to some simple function that maps the event to a persistence command (e.g. create a SQL insert statement).

## Summary

A completely [pure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function) domain, achieved through events, comes with some powerful benefits.

First, some general benefits of purity
- Simplified Testing: Pure domains don't require mocking. The domain no longer relies on injected dependencies, all information is contained in the input and output. 
  - Purity also promotes fast and reliable tests. There is no risk of slow out-of-process infrastructure.
- Clarity: Pure functions have no side-effects. What you see is all you need to think about. This makes them easy to reason about and compose into new applications.
- Parallelization: pure functions have no direct effect on system state and don't interfere with each other. Our whole domain is pure, so our domain is maximally parallelizable. 
- Dry-run domain rules: Separating decisions from enactment of state also means we can preview or dry-run possible actions safely

<!-- TODO: move out parallelization as perhaps the most obvious benefit for scalability.  Not  scalability, as in system throughput, but such a system also comes with benefits for maintenance and system capabilities. -->
