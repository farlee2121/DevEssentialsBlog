Ever considered making a pull request to someones pull request?
Sounds a bit odd, but I've found it smooths collaboration and increases learning opportunities.

I was first introduced to the idea by [Chelsea Troy](https://chelseatroy.com/2019/12/18/reviewing-pull-requests/), and I've found the technique extremely valuable.

Having your code (or any kind of work) reviewed can feel vulnerable. 
Much software work is the result of spending a lot of time with a problem.
Code organization or approaches are often the result of many intersecting design forces coming together in an intricate design.
Explaining a desired change can require pulling in a lot of context.
Plus, non-trivial changes can feel like stacking on work that the author already felt like done.

These stack up to make any sort of substantive code review suggestions... difficult. 
Trying to explain a different approach, why you suggest it, and also keeping the comment short enough to feel achievable is a tall order.

So tall, in fact, that it turns out it's often easier to just make the code change you want to see, and then pull request those changes 
to the reviewed branch with an explanation. The explanation can be shorter because the code itself will provide a lot of context.

The suggestion is also much easier for the code author to receive. They maintain work control over their own work because they decide whether or to merge your work.
They can ask questions or explain their own choices more easily in the contrast between the two versions.
They also aren't being asked to do more work, they can just merge your work if they like it. 
They're left with a lower barrier to adoption and more bandwidth to consider your suggestion. As such, it's also a great way to introduce new ideas to the team.

Overall, forming suggestions as a PR feels more like help and less like a critique.
It greatly reduces friction in reviews and opens up higher-quality opportunities for knowledge sharing.
