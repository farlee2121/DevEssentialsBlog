title: Checklists Distribute Power
---

[Checklist Manifesto](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0312430000) paints an facinating journey of a surgeon who discovered checklists. The book explores checklists across industries and applications, but one lesson pervades them all: use checklists to distribute power.

It's quite impressive how many industries Dr. Gawande explores in his book: construction, aviation, finance, venture funds, and medicine. 
Each of them showing major results from checklists.

The book highlights several checklist qualities distilled from all that experience. Good checklist
- aren't a step-by-step how-to. They prioritize and refresh key points, leaving experts to judge the rest
- encourage discipline, bringing clarity and consistency to the most essential
- are clear, efficient, and usually very short
- encode the obvious but critical
- have clear context for application (or "pause points")

He also highlights useful existing techniques
- Read-do vs Do-confirm styles
- Very short set of routine lists and an extended index of short checklists for emergencies
- Separate checklists, one for detailing the routine and one to make sure people talk and handle the unknown
- Teams should read and confirm checklists aloud
- Even team members using personal, unshared, checklists improves outcomes

## Empowering with checklists

However, one idea recurred over and over again in the book. It's also the idea that excited me most: checklist distribute power.

The key is checklists that encode the "obvious but critical". Everyone can agree the items on the checklist are important.
This creates a clear shared understanding and a basis for members of a group to call each other out.

Even better, such agreed checklists can give those in lower power positions to speak up to those over them and know the leadership has their back.
If properly backed, it sets safe zone that cracks power dynamics. It also eliminates ambiguity and creates efficacy in the most essential work functions.
This actually frees the team up to more creative work because they don't have to fight for the fundamental. I've fought fight that too many times (yes, we should test and use source control...).

Checklist manifesto expands on this idea. It notes how many teams were using a simple check-in of name, role, and expected issues to improve outcomes for the unexpected.
It sounds absurdly simple, but it was measured to be consistently effective.

The key is improved communication. First, people don't communicate well if they don't know each other's names and roles. It's simple but critical and easy to miss in a rush. Remove chance and make sure the team knows each other. Second, requiring each member to speak has an "activation effect", people are more likely to speak up if they've already spoken.
Dr. Gawande takes this even further and suggest the leader should not start a checklist. Having someone with less power start communicates group responsibility and participation.

## Better Wrong Than Vague

I can't resist the connection to [Design of Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Design). After all, I wrote a whole series elaborating on how to constructively [prefer to be wrong rather than vague](../posts/Whats-Your-Duck-V2/2022-06-16-0-Intro.md).

Part of the power of checklists how they push us to clarify what's important and write it down. 
Even more so when the checklist has to be shared or short. Refining the checklist to only the most powerful options is a difficult.
It forces us to be prioritize and agree on what matters most. 

Conversely, it also highlights what's not so important and can be left up to expert judgement. Clarity and autonomy is classic empowerment. 

## Conclusion

I've been experimenting with checklists for a while. I love clarifying the essence of processes. 
I was blown away by the clarity Checklist Manifesto brought to the utility of checklists.
Checklist shouldn't destroy creativity. Done well, they bring a clarity that empowers.
It creates a clear shared understanding of the essentials to distribute power, unite teams, and save our expertise for the hard stuff.
