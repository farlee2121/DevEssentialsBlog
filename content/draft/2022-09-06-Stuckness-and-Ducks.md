title: "Stuckness and Ducks"
---

A recent book I read asserted that stuckness is not a bad thing. It is avoiding our stuckness that is the problem.

The book is Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. It's a wild philosophy ride that contemplates the nature of quality, knowledge, learning, and the universe itself.

> Stuckness is the predecessor to knowledge

Zen posits that humans are terrible at staying stuck. If we can convince ourselves to sit with a problem, we will automatically devise new hypotheses or routes forward.
The problem is when we get uncomfortable or overwhelmed with our stuckness and avoid dealing with the problem.

This is one reason that I love [duck docs](../posts/Whats-Your-Duck-V2/2022-06-16-0-Intro.md), pair programming, and other techniques that push us to communicate our thoughts.

Ducks push me to communicate what I know. This gives me a path forward in the stuckness. Once I've communicated what I know, the problem is more tangible. I also feel a certain attachment or accountability to follow through. Ducking also makes progress through the stuckness more tangible. I have an immediate outlet to start pulling on threads that come up, and to see the facts I nail down as I address each question.

In short, Zen and The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance deepened my love for duck docs. It's clarified the critical role they play for sitting with our stuckness, avoiding feeling overwhelmed, and working through the unknown one little step at a time.
