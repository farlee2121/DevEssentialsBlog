Sports generally have some fundamental that athletes drill endlessly. In fencing, it's footwork. The skill is the foundation for any good execution and needs to be muscle memory if the athlete wants to focus on higher-level skills and strategy. What is the equivalent for software?

I can't speak for developers at large, let alone other roles, but here are some of the skills I've invested long-term intentional practice into. I think they underpin essentially everything I do.

- [small and complete increments of work](../posts/2022-02-25-Stable-Incremental-Additive.md)
  - small and complete commits
  - considering a few alternatives before coding
  - [trying to externally communicate ideas early and often](../posts/Whats-Your-Duck-V2/2022-06-16-0-Intro.md) (maybe just to a text doc, maybe collaborative processes)
- always starting with and constantly tying back to motivations of the work being done
- hypothesis-test cycles
  - Usually Test-Driven Development or a similar test-code loop

This idea was prompted by [Dare to Lead](https://brenebrown.com/hubs/dare-to-lead/), which considered the same for leadership. Great book.
