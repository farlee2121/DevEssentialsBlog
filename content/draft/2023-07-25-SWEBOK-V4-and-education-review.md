The [Software Engineering Body of Knowledge V4](https://www.computer.org/volunteering/boards-and-committees/professional-educational-activities/software-engineering-committee/swebok-evolution)
is due to land in 2023. Here I'll highlite my a [brief article](https://ieeecs-media.computer.org/media/education/swebok/SWEBOK_Education_CSEE_T2023.pdf) that summarizes update to V4 and their impacts for education.

For those who are unfamiliar, the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK) organizes and outlines generally accepted software engineering practices.
It is an [IEEE](https://www.computer.org/) standard meant to set a shared baseline of software knowledge to improve education and training across the field.

The article, [Envisioning software engineer training needs in the digital era through the SWEBOK V4 prism](https://ieeecs-media.computer.org/media/education/swebok/SWEBOK_Education_CSEE_T2023.pdf), is just 5 pages long. Most of it is a table if you want to look up information just the topics that interest you.

What interested me most about the article was that the authors experimented with educational techniques for each of the SWEBOK knowledge areas and suggest educational methods best suited for each topic. Project-based learning and reflection are the overwhelming favorite educational methods across the board. 
This is also reflected in the specific recommendations in various knowledge area comments. Running integrated projects, analyzing past projects, or simulating situations using past projects were regularly mentioned as recommended educational approaches. 

One other noteable recommendation was to teach software construction (i.e. writing code) using tests and examples.

These educational recommendations make sense in light of the key themes in the SWEBOK updates. 
They see the software processes accellerating and becoming more integrated across the lifecycle.
Continuous processes like Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery and the related DevOps movement
underlie many of the updates. 
All this requires developers with a better sense of how quality and flow is impacted throughout the software lifecycle.

The report also calls out low-code/no-code and AI assistance as special topics. 
That fits well with their forecasted acceleration of development flows, and thus developers participating across a more integrated software lifecycle.


With accelerating development cycles, developers increasingly participate in decisions and are not just walled off implementers.
It makes sense that project-based and reflective learning methods are best suited for such an integrated and fast-paced expectations.
Practice and prior examples are key to building the necessary experience.
