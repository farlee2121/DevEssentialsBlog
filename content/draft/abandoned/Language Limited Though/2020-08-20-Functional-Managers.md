This post is not really about dependency injection, but about composition. I want to give a basic idea of how flows come together in FP. Constructor injection is really just the closest analogy from OO

help me solidify (and share) the amazingness of just adapting everything into the flow. So much room for AOP-type decoration, very readable.
