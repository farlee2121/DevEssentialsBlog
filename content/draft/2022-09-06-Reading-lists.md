I've started some [reading lists](../reading-list.md) to help people connect to good literature.

The reading lists are a page, and not a blog post. I intend to update the page over time, and I generally avoid editing my blog posts once their public.

There is a robust body of knowledge out there, but it can hard to get acquainted with. I owe most of my connection to great writings to
other writings I've read. I thought I'd collect some of my favorite books into a list to get others started and short cut the laborious crawl between sources.
