title: Socratic Method, Leading, and Caring
---

I've been using a Socratic approach to promote critical thinking, but it appears to promote good leadership habits as well.

[Dare to Lead](https://brenebrown.com/hubs/dare-to-lead/) is a fantastic book about how to lead in an emotionally intelligent way.
Instead leading with authority or control, the book teaches research-backed ways to build trust and empowerment. 

The socratic instructional approach leans into questions over lectures. Teachers ask students questions and respond to student questions with more questions.
The goal is to create a dialog that encourages a student's own discovery process. Students learn to ask and examine their own questions.

Dare to Lead highlights several leadership skills that I think overlap with the socratic approach.
- Being a Learner over a Knower. Basically, being curious over rushing to provide an answer.
  - Being able to sit in discomfort of unknowns to understand a problem well rather than rush into solutions
  - Bias to think and circle back over pushing through
- Perspective checking. We can't truly put aside our own perspective and take up another's view. We can consider their perspective valuable and be curious about it.
- Checking the stories we tell ourselves. Basically, recognizing when our brain is trying to explain our circumstances by inferring a negative story, then checking those assumptions.
- Checking shared understanding. We naturally bias to assuming others share our perspective and understood information the same, but it's rarely true.
- Clear is kind

All of these ideas are require curiosity and listening to others. The socratic method is a simple rule that facilitates just that.
Biasing to questions also biases us to curiosity and listening.

I think we all have a desired to feel heard, and this can cause us to rush into giving more thoughts than we consider.
This creates an unstable equilibrium. If all participants want to be heard before listening, then no one gets listened to and shared understanding is unlikely.
If we bias to questions, then at least one party in the discussion is being heard and a shared understanding (thus better outcomes) is more likely.
Further, feeling listened to increases chances that other parties will reciprocate and listen to other ideas.

One could say that a leader's job is not to be heard, to help others feel heard. Similarly, not to be valued but to help others feel valued.

In short, the socratic method is not just for teaching critical thinking. I think the socratic method is a simple rule for biasing to curiosity and listening. 
By extension, it promotes understanding those around us and caring for them effectively.

<!-- Socratic method, care, and curiosity (I think part of it was perspective taking, but I'll have to brush up a bit for this post)

knower versus learner.
people feeling heard versus being heard
- if both trying to be heard, talk past each other. If at least one side is trying to hear, then shared understanding might be reached
perspective taking
- We can't really set aside our perspective. It's built-in and permeating. We can, however, consider that the other person's perspective is valid and worth learning about. The key is curiosity.
 
understanding what your team cares about. Bias to assume shared understanding, but shared clarity is hard and hidden assumptions create division over time. -->
