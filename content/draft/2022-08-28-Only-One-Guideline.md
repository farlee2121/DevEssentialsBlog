title: "If I could only have one guideline"
---

I read a lot. I've noticed that some of the most effective books I read share a clear focus.
They have a concise core message and every point is soon explicitly tied back to that core message.

This led me to wonder, what code message would I drive to if I wrote a book on software?

I strongly believe that [programming is problem modeling](../posts/2022-02-18-Programming-is-Problem-Modeling.md).

This phrase could work, but I'd also like to connect into knowledge programmers already have. 
Preferrably also have the core message be an action statement for the reader to apply.

Programmers often call the core of the problem we're solving the *domain*.
A repackaging of problem modeling could be *Reflect the domain*

> Reflect the domain

I'm not 100% sold this is the best phrase, but there is no doubt it reflects how I program.

A potential flaw with this core lesson is communicating the importance of understandability. Mark Seemann does a good job of that with Code That Fits in Your Head.

<!-- Maybe "clarify the domain"?-->

Speaking of which, here are examples of books that do a great job of connecting back to their core message.
