- define acronyms and terms like 
  - PE -> portable executable
  - mvid -> moduleVersionId
  - pdb is actually program database, never knew that. I always though the "db" was for debug


a dll can include multiple modules, but managed executables will only have one

separation of block references and blocks

relative virtual addresses (make sure I get right term here)
- aids translation to machine addresses


try to map relationship of dlls, PE, pdb?
- all part of standards beyond .net (ECMA something)


Namespaces in BCL for working with these kinds of files
