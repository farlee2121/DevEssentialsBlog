title: Shape Up - Importance of Small Teams
---

I think small teams are an underemphasized key element of the [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) approach to project management.

[Shape up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) advocates for larger work scopes and less formal project management. 

The assigned work is usually planned for a full 6-week cycle or for 2 weeks alongside other 2-week items in a 6-week cycle. All direction is provided at a high level in [the pitch](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.5-chapter-06). No additional work decomposition or status meetings are imposed on the team. They manage their own breakdown into tasks and coordination.

Shape Up mentions the team size is usuall 1 designer an 1 or 2 developers. This is mentioned a few times, but not greatly emphasized. However, I think this is a significant element of the approach.

Even a 5-6 person team is too big for everyone, or even most of the team, to keep tabs on each others work.

A 2-3 person team is small enough they don't need any formal meetings or planning. Small enough they could mob the whole time and it wouldn't be odd. Small enough that even if they regularly break off for independent work they're likely to stay aligned through informal chatter. It's a sweet spot where the team is energized by relatively constant alignment but not isolated.

But 2-3 people is also big enough that you can account for different specialties the project may need.

It's also important that these team can change up ever 6 weeks. That's long enough that the team has time to be steeped in the problem together and not lose that momentum. But, it's short enough that you don't have long-term knowledge siloing. The end also isn't very far if the team comp isn't working out or isn't aligning well on the particular problem.

Protecting could be a significant reason 6-week cycles worked for them better than shorter cycles. That's just speculation though.
