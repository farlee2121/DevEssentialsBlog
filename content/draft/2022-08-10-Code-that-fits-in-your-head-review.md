title: "Book Review: Code That Fits in Your Head" 
---

Code That Fits in Your Head tackles a problem dear to my heart. Mark Seemann realized good Software Engineering practices are out there, but it was hard to connect the dots between scattered sources.

Mark seeks to remedy that problem with Code That Fits in Your Head. The book distills leading literature into an actionable personal practice of software.

The book centers around a worked example. This example never feels tedious or like a diversion from the reading. The example weaves a story of practices into a flow, showing the reader healthy personal practice through application.

Mark, as usual, treats his readers like there are smart, yet also breaks down his ideas clearly such that readers of many levels will understand.

It's impressive how Mark manages to borrow ideas from many bodies of software development and make them approachable. He somehow skips much of the difficulty of learning different paradigms (like functional) and presents each idea as a logical progression from values and practices most developers are familiar with.
There's no big fanfare or promise to solve all your problems, it's a practical conclusion.

The book suggests many practices, but shuns dogma with skill. Mark does a great job pointing back to practical goals (like understandable code that fits in your head) and being clear about the essence of what matters in his suggestions.

While focused on personal practice. Code That Fits in Your Head also effectively
connects readers to leading literature. Mark says the book is based on the "shifts sands of personal experience", yet he backs his practices with constant references to well respected literature.

If I have any gripe with this book, I wish there was a clearer roadmap for next steps. Mark mentions topics he avoids, like architecture and legacy code, because they've been covered well elsewhere. However, choosing a book from his many references could be a daunting task. It'd be nice if there were a brief framework in the vein of the [Construx Career Ladder](https://www.construx.com/professional-development-ladder/).

## Conclusion

Code That Fits in Your Head is a masterpiece. It sets out a cohesive and comprehensive approach to personal developer practices. This is hands-down the first resource I'll jump to for training junior devs.
